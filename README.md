# The Odd Order Theorem
The repository contains a [mechanization](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00816699/) of 
the [Odd Order Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feit%E2%80%93Thompson_theorem) (Feit - Thompson, 1963), 
a landmark result of finite group theory, which utilizes the library extensively.

The formal proof is based on the [Mathematical Components](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp)
libraries for the Coq proof assistant.
